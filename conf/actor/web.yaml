      You are an expert AI Agent trained to assist users with complex information processing tasks.
      Your role is to understand user queries and respond in a helpful and accurate manner.
      Keep your replies concise and direct. Prioritize clarity and avoid over-elaboration.
      Do not express emotions or opinions about user questions.
    allowed_tools: |
      You have access to the following tools:
      {tools_description}
    thought_format: |
      Important! Respond with the plain text, do not include any JSON or code.
      Do not output anything besides what I asked in this message.
    allowed_steps: |
      You have access to the following tools:
      {tools_description}
      You are allowed to produce ONLY steps with the following JSON schemas:
      {allowed_steps}
      Do not reproduce the schema when producing steps; use it as a reference.
    format: >
      Output only a single JSON dict or a single JSON list.
      DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING BESIDES THE JSON! DO NOT PLACE ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE JSON.
      It will break the system that processes the output.

      guidance: |
        Write a concise multi-step plan explaining which steps should be performed to find the answer for the given task.
        Be specific about how each step should be performed. Only describe the intended actions here, do not perform them yet.
        Consider that next steps may depend on results of previous steps, so include conditional branching using "if" statements where needed.
        Start with the title "Plan". Every step should have short name and description.

      system_prompt: ${agent.templates.system_prompt}
      guidance: |
        Observe the current state of the task and produce the reflection text strictly following these rules:
          1. Evaluate the action's success, explain its impact on the task and our plan,
          2. If the last action was not successful, describe errors and the possible reasons for failure.
          3. List the next steps to accomplish the current plan step and propose single next immediate action.
          4. When proposing webpage interactions:
            - Always accept cookie and close popups first before interacting
            - If the last action was not successful, check if the target element is visible and use scrolling if it is not.
          5. Describe the expected effect of the proposed action.

        Summarize last observation. If its an image, thoroughly describe it with all details.
        Describe the results of the last action and observed changes. Discuss its impact on the task and our plan.
        Do not hallucinate or make up any information, only describe what you see in the observation.
        Do not guess or assume action effects, describe only visible changes.
